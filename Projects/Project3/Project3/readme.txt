just creating something big, but honestly with chatgpt, so, just for fun
it`s helps for me to download a soundcloud musics.
firsly you should open your liked music page, then scroll this page to down, because you will use ctrl + s for download a .htm + file
in file .htm, you can find the links, which you takes
for example a had probably 290 links after that what i did above
and then i open any of telegram bots, which needs only your link from liked soundcloud music
and source.py simple do ctrl + c from example.txt(here is your links) then switch your window, using alt + tab, then put this link to the telegram bot
so, yeah, hard, but i use that only in one times
